3ω method is the most accurate method to investigate the thermal properties of thin films and bulk materials. Howerver, detection of small voltage variation at the third harmonic needs appropriate signal conditioning circuit to:

1. eliminate the 1st harmonic voltage from the responses which can overload the inputs of the lock-in amplifier
2. Amplify the signals before transferring with long cables to prevent distortion 

A simplified schematic diagram is depicted here:
